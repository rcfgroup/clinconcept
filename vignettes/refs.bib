@article{ONeil:1995,
abstract = {Version 3 of the Read Codes was designed in response to a new set of requirements generated by three new terming initiatives in the UK, the Clinical Terms Project, the Professions Allied to Medicine Terms Project and the Nursing Terms Project. The challenge was to cope with the detail required by clinical specialists for maintaining a computerised record, to capture the natural language used by clinicians in their everyday work, and to support efficient analysis across medical records required to extract information from clinicians' individual patient data. The structure of Version 3 allows a directed acyclic graph to replace the traditional hierarchy; permits multiple such graphs if necessary; introduces qualifiers, embedding these in an information model to support analysis; introduces one-to-many mapping to external classifications where this is necessary; and maintains the tradition of a dynamic terminology that stresses the inclusion of natural clinical terms.},

@article{SNOMED:2010,
abstract = {SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms) is considered to be the most comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology in the world. Each year, avoidable deaths and injuries occur because of poor communication between healthcare practitioners, or because busy practitioners forget or neglect to follow their own criteria for best practices. The delivery of a standard clinical terminology for use across the world's health information systems can therefore make a significant contribution towards improving the quality and safety of healthcare. SNOMED CT aims to contribute to the improvement of patient care through underpinning the development of systems to accurately record health care encounters and to deliver decision support to health care providers. Ultimately, patients will benefit from the use of SNOMED CT to more clearly describe and accurately record their care, in building and facilitating better communication and interoperability in electronic health record exchange, and in creating systems that support health care decision making. SNOMED CT intellectual property rights were transferred to the SNOMED SDO{\{}$\backslash$textregistered{\}} in the formal creation of the IHTSDO. SNOMED CT was originally created by the College of American Pathologists by combining SNOMED RT and a computer based nomenclature and classification known as Clinical Terms Version 3, formerly known as Read Codes Version 3, which was created on behalf of the UK Department of Health and is Crown copyright.},

@article{rpcdsearch:2016, title={Modelling Conditions and Health Care Processes in Electronic Health Records: An Application to Severe Mental Illness with the Clinical Practice Research Datalink}, volume={11}, ISSN={1932-6203}, DOI={10.1371/journal.pone.0146715}, abstractNote={Background The use of Electronic Health Records databases for medical research has become mainstream. In the UK, increasing use of Primary Care Databases is largely driven by almost complete computerisation and uniform standards within the National Health Service. Electronic Health Records research often begins with the development of a list of clinical codes with which to identify cases with a specific condition. We present a methodology and accompanying Stata and R commands (pcdsearch/Rpcdsearch) to help researchers in this task. We present severe mental illness as an example.   Methods We used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a UK Primary Care Database in which clinical information is largely organised using Read codes, a hierarchical clinical coding system. Pcdsearch is used to identify potentially relevant clinical codes and/or product codes from word-stubs and code-stubs suggested by clinicians. The returned code-lists are reviewed and codes relevant to the condition of interest are selected. The final code-list is then used to identify patients.   Results We identified 270 Read codes linked to SMI and used them to identify cases in the database. We observed that our approach identified cases that would have been missed with a simpler approach using SMI registers defined within the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework.   Conclusion We described a framework for researchers of Electronic Health Records databases, for identifying patients with a particular condition or matching certain clinical criteria. The method is invariant to coding system or database and can be used with SNOMED CT, ICD or other medical classification code-lists.}, number={2}, journal={PLOS ONE}, author={Olier, Ivan and Springate, David A. and Ashcroft, Darren M. and Doran, Tim and Reeves, David and Planner, Claire and Reilly, Siobhan and Kontopantelis, Evangelos}, year={2016}, month={Feb}, pages={e0146715}}

@article{ClinicalCodes:2014, title={ClinicalCodes: An Online Clinical Codes Repository to Improve the Validity and Reproducibility of Research Using Electronic Medical Records}, volume={9}, ISSN={1932-6203}, DOI={10.1371/journal.pone.0099825}, abstractNote={Lists of clinical codes are the foundation for research undertaken using electronic medical records (EMRs). If clinical code lists are not available, reviewers are unable to determine the validity of research, full study replication is impossible, researchers are unable to make effective comparisons between studies, and the construction of new code lists is subject to much duplication of effort. Despite this, the publication of clinical codes is rarely if ever a requirement for obtaining grants, validating protocols, or publishing research. In a representative sample of 450 EMR primary research articles indexed on PubMed, we found that only 19 (5.1%) were accompanied by a full set of published clinical codes and 32 (8.6%) stated that code lists were available on request. To help address these problems, we have built an online repository where researchers using EMRs can upload and download lists of clinical codes. The repository will enable clinical researchers to better validate EMR studies, build on previous code lists and compare disease definitions across studies. It will also assist health informaticians in replicating database studies, tracking changes in disease definitions or clinical coding practice through time and sharing clinical code information across platforms and data sources as research objects.}, number={6}, journal={PLOS ONE}, author={Springate, David A. and Kontopantelis, Evangelos and Ashcroft, Darren M. and Olier, Ivan and Parisi, Rosa and Chamapiwa, Edmore and Reeves, David}, year={2014}, month={Jun}, pages={e99825}}
